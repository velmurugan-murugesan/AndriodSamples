In a basic handstand the body is held straight with arms and legs fully extended, with hands spaced approximately shoulder-width apart. There are many variations of handstands, but in all cases a handstand performer must possess adequate balance and upper body strength.",
            "This asana ranges anywhere from a beginner to an intermediate level pose. It stretches the legs, and also qualifies as a balancing pose in the reclining position. Ananta literally means infinite, and it is one of Lord Vishnu’s many nicknames. Ananta is also the name of the 1000-headed serpent that Lord Vishnu rests on. This asana is also called Sleeping Vishnu Pose, Eternal One’s Pose, and also the Side-Reclining Leg Lift.",
    "Yoga mythology holds the moon in great symbolism. The sun and the moon are representative of the polar energies of the human anatomy. In fact, when we address Hatha Yoga, the syllable ‘ha’ is said to signify solar energies, and ‘tha’ signifies lunar energies. This asana is one among the Hatha Yoga asanas, and it is said to channelize your lunar energies."};
